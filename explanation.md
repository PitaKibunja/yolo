# Ansible Automation Project - GitHub README

## Introduction
Hey there! In this README, I'll walk you through a project I've been working on â€“ an automation project using Ansible and Vagrant. This project revolves around creating a development environment in a virtual machine, configuring it, and preparing it for specific tasks. Let's dive in!

## Project Setup

### Vagrant Initialization
First things first, I initiated the project with Vagrant. I used the `vagrant init` command to create a Vagrantfile, which is a configuration file defining our virtual machine's properties and settings.

### Vagrantfile Configuration
The Vagrantfile required some tweaks to meet our project's needs. Here's what I did:

#### Ansible Provisioning
I set up Ansible provisioning in the Vagrantfile. This means Ansible will configure our VM during its creation. I specified the playbook file to be executed as "playbook.yml" and adjusted the verbosity level for Ansible.

```ruby
config.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|
  ansible.playbook = "playbook.yml"
  ansible.verbose = "v"
end
```

#### VirtualBox Configuration
I made some VirtualBox-specific configurations by uncommenting the `config.vm.provider` block. This included modifying the VM's UART mode and adjusting the memory allocation.

```ruby
config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  vb.customize [ "modifyvm", :id, "--uartmode1", "disconnected" ]
  vb.memory = "1024"
end
```

#### Port Forwarding
To enable access to specific ports on the guest VM from the host machine, I added port forwarding rules.

```ruby
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 3000, host: 3000
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 5000, host: 5000
```

### Ansible Role Creation
I created three Ansible roles using `ansible-galaxy init`. Each role serves a specific purpose in configuring our VM:

- **vm-config**: General VM configuration, including environment setup, package installation, and system settings.

- **add-docker**: Installation and configuration of Docker, enabling containerization.

- **clone-repo-run-docker-compose**: Cloning a Git repository and running Docker Compose to deploy an application, along with setting up required environmental variables.

### Role Configuration
For each role, I filled in the necessary files and tasks to achieve their specific purposes. This may involve creating Ansible playbooks, templates, and variable files as needed.

### Playbook (playbook.yml)
A playbook named "playbook.yml" is defined in the Vagrantfile. It orchestrates the application of the Ansible roles, specifying which roles should be applied and in what order.

## Additional Information
To make this project comprehensive, I've documented the purpose of the VM, the applications or services it will host, and any specific configurations required. You'll also find details about external dependencies, like the Git repository that the "clone-repo-run-docker-compose" role works with.
